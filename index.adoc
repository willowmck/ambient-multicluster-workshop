== Preparing Your Environment

Create two clusters and set the environment variables to their context.  You will also need a Gloo Mesh license key. The value below are merely placeholders.  Update them with the correct values for your environment.

This is an important step as the rest of the workshop relies on these environment variables being set.

[source,bash]
----
export CLUSTER1=gke_ambient_one 
export CLUSTER2=gke_ambient_two
export GLOO_MESH_LICENSE_KEY=<your license key>
----

Next, download Solo's 1.25.3 `istioctl` binary.

[source,bash]
----
OS=$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed -E 's/darwin/osx/')
ARCH=$(uname -m | sed -E 's/aarch/arm/; s/x86_64/amd64/; s/armv7l/armv7/')

mkdir -p ~/.istioctl/bin
curl -sSL https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-binaries-e038d180f90a/1.25.3-solo/istioctl-1.25.3-solo-${OS}-${ARCH}.tar.gz | tar xzf - -C ~/.istioctl/bin
chmod +x ~/.istioctl/bin/istioctl

export PATH=${HOME}/.istioctl/bin:${PATH}
----

Verify that you have the correct `istioctl` in your path by executing `istioctl version`.
