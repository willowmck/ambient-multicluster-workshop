== Automatic and Manual Failover

=== productpage failover

Scale down productpage on cluster1 to simulate a failure:

[source,bash]
----
include::scripts/01.sh[]
----

Visit the application in your browser and you'll see traffic is not impacted because we are failing over to cluster2 automatically.

Scale productpage back up.

[source,bash]
----
inclusde::scripts/02.sh[]
----

=== details failover

We can also scale down other services. Let's enable `details` to be multi-cluster and scale it down.

[source,bash]
----
include::scripts/03.sh[]
----

[source,bash]
----
inclusde::scripts/04.sh[]
----

Visit the application in your browser and you'll see traffic is not impacted because we are failing over from productpage.cluster1 to bookinfo.cluster2 automatically.

Scale details back up.

[source,bash]
----
inclusde::scripts/05.sh[]
