== Gloo Management Plane

Optionally, you can deploy the Gloo Management Plane that provides many benefits and features. For this lab, we'll just focus on the UI and the service graph.

Start by downloading the meshctl cli

[source,bash]
----
include::scripts/01.sh[]
----

Cluster1 will act as the management cluster and workload cluster: (see link:examples/mgmt-values.yaml[mgmt-values.yaml] for reference)

[source,bash]
----
include::scripts/02.sh[]
----

Then, register cluster2 as a workload cluster to cluster1:

[source,bash]
----
include::scripts/03.sh[]
----

Launch the UI:

[source,bash]
----
include::scripts/04.sh[]
----
